# Welcome to the Open Match Community!

This is the starting point for becoming a project contributor. You can join the project by contributing code, writing and improving documentation, giving talks about the project, and filing issues. We welcome contributions from all! 

To learn more about the project structure and organization, please review the Project Governance information.

## Communicating

Our primary way of communicating on the project is via GitHub. We share design docs, proposals, etc. here for all to review and comment. It's recommended that you follow the repo for notifications of new issues. 

For general questions or updates/notices there is a project mailing list as well as a project Slack. 

We hold [monthly community meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/143I5DzCYtz8YNBSwz_IiBwACjl9R6uQC40Oro0F9iVs/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone to attend. These meetings are meant to give updates on the project, share cool stuff you're working on, and to offer help to other contributors. The meeting agendas are open for all and are a great way to contribute to the project!

## Governance

Open Match is led by two groups:

- Technical Steering Committee is a small group consisting of the project owners/founders. The TSC charter is to:
  * Set the overall technical direction and project roadmap
  *  Define what constitutes a release; and approve declaring long-term-supported (LTS) releases
  *  Resolve technical issues, technical disagreements and escalations within the project.

- Governance Committee works alongside the TSC. This committee is focused on the administration and governance of the project. The charter is to:
    * Define & evolve project governance structures and policies, including how contributors become committers/maintainers, approvers, reviewers, members, etc.
    * Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding other project resources/assets, including artifact repositories, build and test infrastructure, web sites and their domains, blogs, social-media accounts, etc.
    * Manage the project brand to decide which things can be called "Open Match" and how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors
    * Review Code of Conduct violation reports
